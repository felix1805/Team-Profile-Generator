## Installation

This program using a node.js system that requires specific node package management. Thus once the repository has been downloaded, a user must run "npm init" in the command console to install npm on a machine. Once this command has been completed, "npm install inquirer" needs to run to install the specific inquirere modules. Once all npm specific components have been installed, the program can be initialized and ran using the "node index.js" command in the console. After answering all questions, the user will then receive a custom HTML file that will deploy in the "dist" folder of the application tree.
